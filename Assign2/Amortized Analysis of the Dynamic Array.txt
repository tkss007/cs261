Amortized Analysis of the Dynamic Array (Written)

1. 56

8 + 8 + 16 + 24 


2. 260
8 + 10 + 12 + â€¦.. + 32
8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 = 60
3. The initial capacity of the array is assumed that N / 2, if you do not have a pop-up followed by a push operation will take O (N ^ 2) of the total cost. This can be avoided by shrinking an array of policy changes to reduce (pop only), halved its capacity, when full array quarter or less.
